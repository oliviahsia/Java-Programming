Occasion: 
Developing a Person Management System

Task Description:
The task was to develop a command-line-based Person Management System using Java, allowing users to input their choice to execute the add, update, delete, find, display, and exit operations on a list of persons.

Implementation:
1. I created a Person class to represent individual persons with name and age attributes.
2. Implemented methods for adding, updating, deleting, finding, and displaying persons within the system.
3. Used an ArrayList to store the list of persons and utilized switch-case statements to handle user input and perform appropriate actions.

Structure of the program:
To improve the readability, maintainability, and testability of the code. 

In the "Person" class, private fields name and age, and provided a constructor and corresponding getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes. Additionally, also overrode the toString() method for convenient printing of Person object information.

In the ArrayListPeople class, use instances of the Person class to create an ArrayList and perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting, finding, and displaying persons.
